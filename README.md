Fetch Rewards Take-home Exercise - Machine Learning Engineer
I've used two methods to address this issue: linear regression (a linear algorithm) and neural networks (a nonlinear algorithm). Both models yield comparable results primarily because the input data is relatively simple, consisting only of days or months. Currently, my focus is on my research project, so I haven't had the opportunity to delve into concerns related to underfitting and overfitting. I'd be more than happy to discuss my deeper understanding of machine learning concepts in the interview. I regret that I haven't had the time to develop an application for the trained model to provide predicted results. Nevertheless, you can easily follow my instructions within the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code.
